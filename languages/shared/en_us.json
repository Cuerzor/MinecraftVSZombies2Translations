  "chat.halloween_map.11.0.2": "Hey neighbor! We finally get to go there!",
  "chat.halloween_map.11.0.3": "However, there are two things you need to keep in mind.",
  "chat.halloween_map.11.0.4": "First, this key can only teleport you to the Dream World. If you wish to truly arrive in Gensokyo, you will have to look for a method to access the reality world.",
  "chat.halloween_map.11.0.5": "Second... Gensokyo is currently a big mess.",
  "chat.halloween_map.11.0.6": "Hmm? Why?",
  "chat.halloween_map.11.0.7": "As you can see here, a lot of monsters started to appear out of nowhere, and they all have this... weird blocky shape.",
  "chat.halloween_map.11.0.8": "These blocky monsters seem to have spread all the way to Gensokyo, so its reality world is now nothing but chaos.",

  "chat.halloween_map.2.0.4": "...You know me?",
  "chat.halloween_map.2.0.5": "Ah, I've heard of it.",
  "chat.halloween_map.2.0.6": "In our villages, we rely on Iron Golems to defend from those monsters!",
  "chat.halloween_map.2.0.7": "And you, should be the creator of the Iron Golem prototypes?",
  "chat.halloween_map.2.0.8": "Iron Golems... Ah, sort of.",
  "chat.halloween_map.2.0.9": "But... I've long since abandoned those things.",
  "chat.halloween_map.2.name": "Halloween Day 2 Map",
  "chat.halloween_map.3.0.0": "Is this... Glowstone?",
  "chat.halloween_map.3.0.1": "A kind of glowing stone from the Nether... Extremely rare in the overworld.",

  "chat.halloween_map.4.name": "Halloween Day 4 Map",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.0": "Hm, speaking of which... Why did you guys follow that map all the way over here?",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.1": "Ah! I almost forgot!",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.10": "That monster... was so strong that fleeing was my only choice. And the key was robbed at that time.",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.11": "Oh, that ain’t good.",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.2": "We wanna go to another world called Gensokyo! We’ve been looking everywhere for a way to get there!",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.3": "Go to... another world... Right, I do have such a method for that.",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.4": "I have a magical key, it can open a portal to the Dream World, which connects to other worlds.",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.5": "Ooh, is that so? Then could you help send us there?",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.6": "Um... To be honest, there’s a problem.",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.7": "That key was stolen.",
  "chat.halloween_map.5.0.8": "...? Stolen?",

  "chat.halloween_map.5.name": "Halloween Day 5 Map",
  "chat.halloween_map.6.0.0": "So, what's the monster that attacked you?",
  "chat.halloween_map.6.0.1": "A giant, terrible and strong corpse monster, filled with enormous amount of electricity. It's called... Frankenstein.",
  "chat.halloween_map.6.0.2": "Frankenstein? But that's just some fictional stuff from a novel!",
  "chat.halloween_map.6.0.3": "I also thought it was... but it really does exist.",
  "chat.halloween_map.6.0.4": "Sorry for my negligence... the situation shouldn't have been like this.",
  "chat.halloween_map.6.0.5": "Never mind that, we just need to get the key back!",
  "chat.halloween_map.6.0.6": "...If you wish to fight against the monster, please be careful...",
  "chat.halloween_map.6.name": "Halloween Day 6 Map",
  "chat.halloween_map.7.0.0": "So, that key, just what is it actually?",
  "chat.halloween_map.7.0.1": "That key is called the Dream Key.",
  "chat.halloween_map.7.0.2": "Using the Dream Key is one way to travel to other worlds. It allows you to enter the dream of a world.",
  "chat.halloween_map.7.0.3": "Then by finding a way to access the reality of the world from its dream, you can ultimately travel to different worlds",
  "chat.halloween_map.7.0.4": "Sounds like a cool thing to me!",
